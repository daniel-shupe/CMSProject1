<h1>Trials of Faith Roleplaying Game Morality Overiew</h1>
<p>
    The ideas of morals and values are spread through The Bible.  As Christian soldiers, your adventurer must follow the moral code outlined
    by God.  Following God's will, your character will earn faith, and once your faith level is high enough, you can invoke powerful miracles
    to turn the tides.  Using miracles will allow you to accumulate faith faster, as well as increase your reputation with non-player characters.
